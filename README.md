This project is build on MERN stack.
The Responsive Academic Portal project is to create a safe, user-friendly portal for staff, parents, and 
students in order to improve communication and information exchange in educational institutions. 
User-friendly buttons allow users to pick staff, parent, or student. When parents enter their child's roll 
number, the system verifies it against the database and then sends an OTP to the registered cellphone 
number. Once the OTP has been successfully verified, parents can view their child's attendance or 
grade history. In a similar vein, personnel and students can access data pertinent to their positions.
By requesting an OTP verification, the portal protects user privacy and data security by 
preventing illegal access to personal information.To make sure that only authorized users may access 
critical information, this verification step comprises sending an OTP to the user's registered mobile 
number. Strong data security and privacy are maintained via the backend system, which also handles 
authentication, data retrieval, and OTP verification.
Overall, by enabling safe, effective, and role-specific information exchange, the portal 
encourages openness, participation, and collaboration within the academic community. This solution 
facilitates good communication between all stakeholders, which not only protects personal data but also 
fosters a positive learning atmosphere.
